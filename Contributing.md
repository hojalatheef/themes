# Basic Rules

All Code in themes is GPL, so all you contribute is also GPL code.

We all want to make the theming easier, so please be patient.

# Creating an issue

Please use __polite language__.

Please just describe __one__ problem per issue.

Please provide __as much information as possible__, normally the following information is highly important for fixing problems.

* used TYPO3 Version
* used PHP Version
* used Extension versions (themes.*, theme_.*, dyncss.*, etc.)

Additionally we need information to reproduce the problem.

* What did you want to achieve?
* What have you done?
* What happened?
* What have you expected to happen?
* Are there any error messages?

If there are other special environment settings or things please provide them as well.

And finally please bring some time, normally we can't react in minutes :smiley:
