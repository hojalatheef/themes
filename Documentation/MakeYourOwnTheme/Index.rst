Make your own theme
===================

Templating strategy
-------------------

To make your own theme you have to choose a templating engine. You can choose at least between:

* pure TYPOScript
* fluidcontent and fluidpages
* gridelements
* automaketemplate (not test, but should work)
* any other templating engine which is controllable with TYPOScript (even with userfunctions)

Structure of a theme
--------------------

Extensions containing Themes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A theme is basicly a set of TYPOScript files stored in an extension with some additional meta data.

.. table:: Minimum set of files for a theme

	======================================== ======================================================================
	 File                                    Function of the file
	======================================== ======================================================================
	ext_emconf.php                           Needed for every extension in TYPO3
	ext_icon.gif                             Icon for the extensionmanager
	Meta/theme.yaml                          contains some meta data
	Configuration/Theme/constants.typoscript contains constants to easily configure a theme
	Configuration/Theme/setup.typoscript     contains the needed TYPOScript to render the frontend
	Configuration/Theme/tsconfig.typoscript  contains the PageTS to configure the pagebranch of a selected theme
	======================================== ======================================================================

Additionally there are some files, which are useful to achieve some higher goals.

.. table:: Other useful files

	================================= ======================================================================
	 File                             Function of the file
	================================= ======================================================================
	Resources/Private/*               contains resources, which are not served to the user
	Resources/Public/*                contains resources, which are normally served to the user
	Documentation/*                   contains theme documentation
	ext_tables.php                    usually contains backwards compat stuff to use a theme standalone
	Configuration/TypoScript          used for compatibility with ext_tables.php
	================================= ======================================================================

Themes - the alternative way of shipping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Kickstarting a theme
--------------------

You may use ext:themes_builder to generate the structure with just a bunch of clicks.

@todo insert more information about the themes_builder here.

Minimal TYPOScript of a theme
-----------------------------

If you want to make a theme with as less TYPOScript as possible, you may use fluidcontent and fluidpages to make the
progress easier.
Using this libraries you just need to configure where to find the definitions of pagelayout and elements.

This way you can built layouts with nearly no TYPOScript.

Additionally you may use EXT:themes_fces_fluidcontent_basic to use a big and growing library of usefull content
elements, which can be easily adjusted.
