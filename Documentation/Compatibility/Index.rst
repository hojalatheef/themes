Add your own theme model to the repository
------------------------------------------

You may create your own model for handling special usecases of themes. This way it's possible to e.g. use
templavoila_framework skins or similar stuff with themes by simulating the needed libs.

You may find examples in the extension EXT:themes_adapter_templavoilaframework or in EXT:themes_adapter_wordpress.
